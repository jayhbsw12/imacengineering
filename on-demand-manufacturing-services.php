            <div class="faq-answer">
               <p>On-demand manufacturing is a production approach where goods are manufactured only when an order is received, 
                rather than in anticipation of future sales. This approach utilizes technologies like 3D printing and CNC machining
                 to produce items in exact quantities needed, from single prototypes to low-volume production runs.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
               <p>On-demand manufacturing typically begins with a digital design file (CAD model) provided by the customer. 
                This file is then used by advanced manufacturing, such as 3D printers or CNC machines, to produce the physical
                 part or product. The process is highly automated, allowing for quick setup and production once an order is placed,
                  eliminating the need for large inventories.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
               <p> The core difference lies in the production process: on-demand manufacturing produces after an order,
                 while traditional manufacturing produces before an order (in anticipation of demand).</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p> On-demand manufacturing offers several key advantages, such as reduced waste & inventory that
                     eliminates overproduction and the need for large stockroom, lower upfront costs that minimize
                      investment in tooling and large production runs, faster time-to-market that pushes prototyping 
                      and production, especially for new products, increased flexibility & customization,n which allows
                       for easy design iterations and personalized products and minimizes risk that reduces the financial 
                       risk associated with unsold inventory.</p>
