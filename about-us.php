                     In 2020, when the world was changing rapidly, most companies were figuring out how to adapt. But at that time, we were already three steps ahead, building something extraordinary. <br> <br>
                     That's when iMAC Design & Engineering came into existence. Not just as another design and engineering company, but as your one-stop partner for product design and development. We created a place where brilliant ideas don't just get sketched on paper, they get converted into reality. <br> <br>
                      <span id="dots"></span>
                      <span id="more" style="display: none;"> We didn't start iMAC because we thought the world needed another design firm. We started it because we saw a gap (a massive one) in the global market. <br> <br>
                      We are a cross-functional team of 20+ experts - Project Managers, R&D Technical Manager, AM CAD Design Engineer, 3D Printer Operator, Project Engineer, Embedded Lead Engineer, and a team of Mechanical/Industrial 
                      Design Engineers, plus many other experts..united by curiosity and driven by developments! <br> <br>

                      After delivering over 100 projects across 30+ global partnerships, we know one thing for certain: product success requires
                       alignment, not fragmentation. That’s why we bring the entire journey of a product from concept to manufacturing, 
                       all under one roof with a focused team.<br><br>
                      
                      Based in Ahmedabad, India, our 1250 sq. ft. facility is designed to support every stage of product development. 
                      We are here to create an iMAC difference by making the product look and work better, serve people better, and change 
                      the world a little. <br> <br>

                      Over the last 5 years, we have been proving that innovation is not just about having the latest technology 
                      (though we have that). It's about having the right people, processes, and passion to turn your vision into reality. <br> <br>

                      Welcome to iMAC Design & Engineering… where your next brilliant product is just a conversation away. <br> <br>
