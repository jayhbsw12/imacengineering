         <p>Managing multiple suppliers, coordinating different components, and ensuring everything fits together perfectly is not a job for any production team. That's where our complete assembly integration services make all the difference. </p>

         <p>Our three-stage process transforms loose components into functional units, then smoothly integrates everything into your final product. Years of experience across the automotive, aerospace, electronics, and medical device industries have taught us how to handle complex builds with precision. Our assembly is performed in clean, controlled conditions with specialized equipment, automated systems, and skilled technicians to maintain micron-level precision throughout the process.</p>

         <p>Plus, our advanced additive manufacturing capabilities mean we can create custom components when standard parts won't work. iDES delivers reliable integration solutions that eliminate your coordination problems and ensure every part of your product works together perfectly.</p>

               <p>Integration services in product design and development involve combining various components, systems, or software modules to ensure they function together as a complete product. This includes integrating mechanical, electrical, software, and industrial design elements into a unified solution.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
               <p>The integration process typically begins with defining system architecture and interfaces, followed by component selection and testing (both individually and in sub-assemblies). It then progresses to assembly, systematic testing of the combined system for functionality and performance, and iterative refinement to resolve any conflicts or ensure optimal interoperability across all integrated elements.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, rapid tooling is highly suitable for low-volume production. Its speed and lower cost per tool make it an 
                    excellent choice for producing hundreds or thousands of parts before committing to expensive, high-volume 
                    traditional tooling, or for bridge production between prototyping and mass manufacturing.</p>
