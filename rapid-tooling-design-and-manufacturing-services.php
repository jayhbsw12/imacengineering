                  <p>Rapid tooling is a method of quickly creating molds, dies, or other manufacturing tools, primarily
                     for prototyping or low-volume production. It leverages additive manufacturing (3D printing) and
                     high-speed machining to produce tooling much faster and often more affordably than conventional
                     methods.</p>

                  <p>Rapid tooling differs from traditional tooling primarily in its speed, cost, and typical volume
                     suitability. Traditional tooling involves lengthy, expensive processes like EDM of hard metals for
                     high-volume, durable molds. Rapid tooling utilizes faster, often additive methods and less durable
                     materials, ideal for quick iterations, prototypes, or low to medium production runs. </p>

               <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Rapid tooling can use a variety of materials, including polymers (plastics), composites, and even
                     some metals. Common materials include photopolymers, ABS, nylon, and various resins for 3D printed
                     molds, as well as softer aluminum alloys or high-density epoxies for machined tools.</p>

               <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Rapid tooling employs various mold types, including injection molds, vacuum forming molds, blow
                     molds, and soft tooling inserts. These molds can be 3D printed directly (e.g., plastic molds for
                     silicone casting or short-run injection molding) or produced by rapidly machining softer metals or
                     tooling boards.</p>

               <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Yes, rapid tooling is highly suitable for low-volume production. Its speed and lower cost per tool
                     make it an excellent choice for producing hundreds or thousands of parts before committing to
                     expensive, high-volume traditional tooling, or for bridge production between prototyping and mass
                     manufacturing.</p>
